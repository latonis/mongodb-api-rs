# mongodb-api-rs

Hi! This is a small API written in Rust that leverages the MongoDB and Rocket creates to form a simple API that you can pull examples from and leverage when looking to write a new API in Rust.

## Contents

This API covers the basics of a CRUD API:

- MongoDB database connections and pools
- GET requests
- POST requests
- PATCH requests
- DELETE requests

## Side Note (disclaimer)

ü•ê The recipes under [`bread_data.json`](bread_data.json) are not real recipes, please do not try to cook them. I wrote a python script to randomly generate with 1 to 4 ingredients and random uint32 values for temperature and cook time. ü•ñ
